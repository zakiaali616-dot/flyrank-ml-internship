# FlyRank Refresh Opportunity Model Report

This report is generated from the bundled anonymized starter dataset (`data/raw/content_refresh_anonymized.csv`).
The model ranks existing content for refresh review. It does not use titles, URLs, client names, domains, or keywords.

## Data

- Rows scored: 30,000
- Declining-label rows: 16,262
- Declining-label rate: 0.542
- Split strategy used for validation: client_holdout
- Target: `is_declining_label`

## Model Comparison

Best model: `random_forest` selected by `precision_at_50`.

## Practical Use

Use the ranked queue as a reviewer aid, not as an automatic publishing decision.
The safest first production use is to inspect high-confidence rows, verify the page manually, and compare the recommendation against editorial context.
